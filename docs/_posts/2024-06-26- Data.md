## Similarity coefficients

SMC

This measure counts both presences and absences equally. Consequently, the
SMC could be used to find students who had answered questions similarly on
a test that consisted only of true/false questions

Jaccard

Jaccard coefficient is frequently used to handle objects consisting of asymmetric binary attributes.
Suppose that x and y are data objects that represent two rows (two transactions) of a transaction matrix, If each asymmetric binary attribute corresponds to an item in a store, then a 1 indicates that the item was purchased, while a 0 indicates that the product was not purchased. Sincb the number of products not purchased by any customer far outnumbers the number of products that were purchased, a similarity measure
such as SMC would say that all transactions are very similar.
